# Morgan Stone is a UI/UX architect, product designer, and front-end engineer.

I am a UI/UX architect which is something between being a product designer and front-end engineer. My day to day changes based on the needs of the business. Some days I am working with stakeholders while prototyping and testing new features in Sketch and InVision. Other days I am coding and reviewing front-end code written in Javascript, HTML, and CSS. I specialize in building Angular (both 1 and 2+) single page apps. I've also built out some React apps. 

In my off time I am a Course Instructor at UAB where I teach graphic design majors the principles of user experience and how to code HTML and CSS.

## Product Designer
I work with stakeholders to prototype and develop new features in Sketch and InVision.
